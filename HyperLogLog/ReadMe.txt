HyperLogLog (HLL) is a probabilistic data structure used for estimating the cardinality of a set (i.e., the number of distinct elements) with high accuracy and low memory usage. 
HyperLogLog is a clever way to estimate the number of unique items in a very large list, like a list of website visitors or a list of search terms.
Imagine you have a really long list of items, and you want to know how many unique items are in that list. 
HyperLogLog helps you estimate that number without having to look at every single item.
