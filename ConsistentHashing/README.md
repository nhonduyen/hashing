Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table. 
It allows for efficient data distribution and minimal reorganization when nodes are added or removed from the system.

Use cases for Consistent Hashing:

Distributed Caching Systems: Used in systems like Memcached and Redis to distribute data across multiple cache servers.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): To determine which server should handle a particular request based on the content's URL.
Load Balancing: In distributed systems to evenly distribute requests or data across a cluster of servers.
Distributed Databases: Used in NoSQL databases like Cassandra and DynamoDB for data partitioning and replication.
Distributed Storage Systems: In systems like Amazon's Dynamo for distributing data across multiple storage nodes.
Peer-to-Peer Networks: For efficiently locating resources in P2P networks.
Microservices Architecture: To route requests to the appropriate service instance in a microservices environment.
Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs): Used in the implementation of DHTs, which are fundamental to many P2P systems.
Sharding in Databases: To determine which shard should contain a particular piece of data.
Distributed Cron Jobs: To distribute scheduled tasks across multiple servers in a predictable manner.
Distributed Message Queues: To determine which queue server should handle a particular message.
Distributed File Systems: To determine which server should store a particular file or chunk of a file.

Consistent hashing is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to distribute data or load across a changing set of servers while minimizing data movement when the server 
set changes. It provides better scalability and flexibility compared to traditional hash-based distribution methods, especially in dynamic environments where servers can be added
or removed frequently.
